# Overview
This project is a way for me to showcase my machine learning skills in a retail environment. The main obective of this project is to create a predictive model to create a forecast and also to see what factors affect the stores sales

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras scikeras
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bowman1410/-Retail_Store_Analysis.git
cd <repository-directory>
```
2. Open the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook ML_Analysis_Retail.ipynb
```

## Data Sources
I was able to access data from a link used in the notebook. The dataset include features (but is not limited to) like:
* Date
* Sales Data
* Markdowns
* Departments
* Stores

## Machine Learning Models
A variety of machine learning models were used and tested in order to find the best fit. The models used include:
* Linear Regression
* Keras Neural Network
* LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Neural Network

## Analysis
Both Time Series Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis were used in this project
